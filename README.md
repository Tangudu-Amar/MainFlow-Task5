# Feature Engineering and Selection for Model Training

## Description

This project focuses on engineering new features and selecting relevant features from existing data for model training. The main goal is to optimize feature sets to improve model performance.

## Responsibilities

1. **Generate Meaningful Features**:
   - Create new features from the existing data to enhance the model's predictive power.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Use techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or feature importance metrics to identify and select the most important features.

3. **Optimize Feature Sets**:
   - Continuously evaluate and refine the feature sets to ensure optimal model performance.
